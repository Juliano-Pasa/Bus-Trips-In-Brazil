         ANTT holds records of regular trips registered from [2019 to 2024]({ProjectConstants.REGULAR_TRIPS_URL}). 
         However, some of the trips are duplicates or wrongly inserted records. 
         Because of this, there are several "trips" of the same bus departing at the same time, 
         which I decided to name as **ghost trips**.
